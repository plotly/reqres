While the http protocol is rather basic in essence, it can be a pain to work 
with. `reqres` is here to soothe the pain somewhat by providing two powerful
classes for handling all parts of request and response handling during a http
exchange. *This is not a web server*, instead it focuses on making life easier
for developers of web servers by extracting the complexity of cookies, headers,
content negotiation, and the likes into neat little classes. `reqres` builds
upon the [`rook`](https://github.com/jeffreyhorner/Rook/blob/a5e45f751/README.md)
specifications and is thus well suited for 
[`httpuv`-based](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv) webservers.

## Features
`reqres` draws a lot of inspiration from [express.js](https://expressjs.com) and
the `Request` and `Response` classes is aiming for feature parity with those 
from express... TBD
